    <h3> What is Ragu? </h3>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Ragù</strong> is a meat-based sauce, typically served with pasta. Traditionally, pieces of meat (often beef, pork, game, or even horse), are cooked on a low heat in a braising liquid (this is usually tomato or wine-based) over a long period of time.
</p> <p>There are a multitude of ragù recipes enjoyed across Italy – specific regions, provinces and communes across the peninsula boast their own version of the famed sauce. For instance, Naples is home to ragù Napoletano, whereas on a Sunday afternoon in Puglia, you’ll likely see ragù alla Barese (ragù from Bari – the region’s capital) on the table. Of course, Ragù alla Bolognese is perhaps the most famous example of a ragù, the much-loved sauce hailing from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna, in Italy's north.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons harissa (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 pound pappardelle pasta, cooked and drained </li>
      <li>grated Parmesan cheese, for serving </li>
    </ul>
  <br>

     <h3>Steps To Follow</h3>
<br>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Sear meat until browned on every side, working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.

</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.

</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</p></li>
